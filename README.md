# PyBer Analysis

## Overview and Purpose
In this analysis, we used Python with Pandas and Matplotlib in order to analyze PyBer ride data from rural, suburban, and urban cities. Our goal in this analysis was to determine:
1. The total number of rides per type of city.
2. The total number of drivers per type of city.
3. The total fare amount per type of city.
4. The average fare per ride in each type of city.
5. The average fare per driver in each type of city.
6. The total fare amount per week per type of city.

Determining, analyzing, visualizing, and udnerstanding these metrics can help PyBer to make strategic decisions about how to increase revenue in rural, suburban, and urban areas. 

##  Results
It may not be a surprise that there are many more rides (13 times as many) in urban areas as opposed to rural areas. Looking at the chart below offers additional insights that will be of interest to PyBer.

Although there are 13 times as many rides in urban areas, there are actually 30.8 as many drivers, and only 9.2 times as much in fares collected. That being said, the average fare per driver is dramatically different in urban and rural areas, due to the fact that there seems to be more drivers than demand in urban areas. There is less of a discrepancy between number of rides and total fare between rural and suburban areas. Suburban areas have 5 times as many rides, and about 4.4 times as much total fare. 

Another way to see the relationship between number of drivers, rides, and total fare in each area is to look at the following pie charts.

While it is true that urban areas make up the majority of rides and total fares, there is an overrepresentation of drivers in urban areas, accounting for almost 81% of total PyBer drivers.

One final way to visualize this data is to focus on the total fare over time, as shown in this line graph:

Reviewing this graph shows, again, that urban areas are generating much more revenue than suburban or rural areas. However, there is also a bit less stability, as we see in the dramatic peaks and valleys from late February 2019 to late March 2019.

## Summary
After reviewing all of the data, it is immediately clear that urban areas have been, and likely will continue to be, the biggest contributors to the total revenue that PyBer brings in each month. It is also clear that potential drivers have picked up on the fact that there are significantly more rides requested in urban cities, and there are therefore a disproportionate amount of drivers in urban areas.

Some suggestions for improving business based on these findings are:
1. Recruit additional drivers in suburban and rural areas, with a particular focus on rural areas.
2. Offer promotions in suburban and rural areas that will bring down the average fare for a ride in order to increase demand.
3. Evaluate performance of drivers in urban cities in order to remove lower-performing drivers, and therefore increase average fare per driver so that high-performing drivers can complete more rides, make more money, and ultimately be more satisfied.
